# 🔐 Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using AutoML

A real-time, stream-based Intrusion Detection System built using Python, River (online learning), Flask (API), and Streamlit (dashboard).  
Trained on the CICIDS2017 dataset, this system uses adaptive machine learning and drift detection to identify network threats in real time.
